# aneesh-portfolio  
A collection of coding and industrial engineering projects.  

## About This Repo  
This repo is where I’m documenting my journey as an industrial engineer. Each project dives into a different area of the field—from manufacturing efficiency to ergonomics—and shows how coding, data, and problem-solving can come together to make processes better. As I grow, I’ll keep adding more projects and skills here.  

## Projects  

### 1. Production Line Optimization Simulator  
- **What it does**: Simulates a production line to spot bottlenecks and improve efficiency  
- **Concepts**: Queuing theory, lean manufacturing, process control  
- **Tech**: Python, NumPy, SciPy  

### 2. Supply Chain Network Analyzer  
- **What it does**: Models supply chains to optimize cost and resilience  
- **Concepts**: Network flow, facility location, inventory management  
- **Tech**: Python, NetworkX, PuLP  

### 3. Quality Control Analysis Tool  
- **What it does**: Uses stats to track process quality and Six Sigma metrics  
- **Concepts**: SPC, Six Sigma, process capability  
- **Tech**: Python, SciPy  

### 4. Facility Layout Optimizer  
- **What it does**: Designs efficient facility layouts with better material flow  
- **Concepts**: Workflow design, optimization methods  
- **Tech**: Python, genetic algorithms  

### 5. Inventory Management System  
- **What it does**: Forecasts demand and optimizes inventory decisions  
- **Concepts**: EOQ, demand forecasting, supply chain cost optimization  
- **Tech**: Python, time series analysis  

### 6. Ergonomic Workstation Assessment  
- **What it does**: Evaluates workstation setups for safety and comfort  
- **Concepts**: Human factors engineering, ergonomic design  
- **Tech**: Python, anthropometric data

## Setup  
Clone the repo and check individual project folders for requirements and instructions.
  - git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aneesh-portfolio.git

## What's Next  

I plan to keep building:

  Web apps for easier interaction
  
  Real-time data integration
  
  Machine learning for predictions
  
  More projects (predictive maintenance, energy optimization, robotics, digital twin modeling)
